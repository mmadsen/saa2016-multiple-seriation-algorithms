Seriation is a set of methods which uses patterns in the occurrence or abundance of historical classes to construct an ordering among otherwise unordered assemblages or objects [@Dunnell:1970aa].  Traditionally, the orders constructed by seriation were intended to be chronological, since seriation was intended for use as a relative dating method by its early 20th century developers [@o2000applying; @o1998james; @Lyman:2006aa; @OBrien1999b; @lyman1997rise].  But seriation techniques also create orderings which incorporate the effects of spatial variation in addition to temporal change, as James Ford pointed out [@Ford:1938aa; @Phillips1951; @Ford:1935aa].

Despite the success of seriation in understanding the large-scale structure of the archaeological record in the New World [@Beals1945;@Bluhm1951;@Evans1955;@Ford1949;@Kidder1917;@Mayer-Oakes1955;@Meggers1957;@Phillips1951;@Rouse1939;@Smith1950], the method has largely been ignored since the advent of radiocarbon dating given its primary association as a relative dating method. But seriation is only a dating method in the sense that chronology is one possible inference from mapping the spatiotemporal pattern of change in cultural variants.  Other inferences are possible, and in particular, there is a growing understanding that seriation is one of several methods for inferring historical and heritable continuity and thus documenting the evolutionary history of past populations [e.g., @OBrien1999b, Ch. 3].

Similarity between classes of artifacts constitutes heritable continuity when it arises from information being passed between populations over time; that is, from cultural transmission processes.  Although the fact that seriation, in some sense, measures cultural transmission has been implicit since the earliest discussions of the method, the connection remained a common sense generalization until the mid 1990's.  Fraser Neiman, in his dissertation and later his seminal 1995 article, noted that the unimodal patterns that form the core of the traditional frequency seriation technique are regularly seen in the trajectories seen when simulating unbiased transmission [@Neiman1995].  In order to make this connection both rigorous and useful in empirical work, we began a research program aimed at exploring the connection between cultural transmission models and seriation methods [@Lipo1997Population], which has resulted in numerous publications, new seriation software algorithms, and many conference papers [@huntmadsenlipo1995a; @lipomadsenhunt1995b; @Lipo2008; @Lipo2001; @Lipo2001a; @Lipo2005; @lipomadsen1997;@lipomadsendunnell2015; @Madsen2014; @madsenlipo2015b; @Madsen2008;  @o2015design]. 

The core of the all seriation techniques are a set of "ordering principles" which describe how the data points making up each assemblage or object are rearranged in order to achieve a valid seriation solution.  Traditionally, there are two [@Dunnell:1970aa; @Rouse1967; @Whitlam:1981vs].  The "occurrence principle" states that a valid ordering leaves no temporal gaps in the distribution of the historical classes used, and thus that temporal orders are continuous [@dempsey1963statistical; @rowe1959archaeological].  The "frequency principle" states that in a valid ordering, the frequencies making up the continuous distribution of each historical type will be unimodal, possessing a single peak of "popularity" [@Nelson1916].  

Both principles work, as demonstrated by the robustness and continued utility of the basic chronological frameworks erected by culture historians in the first half of the 20th century using seriation along with stratigraphy and marker types [@lyman1997rise].  The frequency principle remains, however, an empirical generalization which is only suggested by the behavior of cultural transmission models, rather than being a necessary consequence.  This suggests to us that seriation as a method requires further methodological development, especially if it is to be one of our major tools in tracing historical and heritable continuity in the archaeological record.[^1]  


INTRODUCTION INCOMPLETE UNTIL LATER SECTIONS DRAFTED


# Seriation and the Frequency Principle

Seriation, in the Americanist sense, was initially developed by Alfred Kroeber [@Kroeber1916] in the Southwest, on the basis of changes in ceramic decorations from Zuni Pueblo.  The primitive seriation proposed by Kroeber was quickly amended by Leslie Spier, Alfred V. Kidder and Nels C. Nelson all of whom were conducting stratigraphic excavations in the American Southwest [@Kidder1917;@Nelson1916;@Spier1917]. This group of researchers all noticed that when ceramics were described in a particular way -- called "stylistic" by Kidder [-@Kidder1917] -- the temporal distribution of the types took the form of "normal curves."  Using such types, it was apparent that a series of assemblages collected from the surface or otherwise undated could be arranged in chronological order by rearranging them so that all type distributions approximated "normal curves" simultaneously.  The orders constructed in this way could also be tested by finding stratified deposits and were found to be correct.  

As powerful as seriation proved to be, these early formulations were entirely intuitive and based on the generalization that greater temporal differences between assemblages caused larger differences between frequencies of decorated types, and that properly constructed historical types displayed a clear pattern of change [@Phillips1951, p. 220]:

> If our pottery types are successful measuring units for a continuous stream of changing cultural ideas, it follows that when the relative popularity of these types is graphed through time, a more or less long, single-peak curve will usually result.  Put in another way, a type will first appear in very small percentages, will gradually increase to its maximum popularity, and then, as it is replaced by its succeeding type, will gradually decrease and disappear.

This compactly describes the "popularity principle," originally articulated by Nelson [-@Nelson1916] and Wissler [-@wissler1916application].  A key word in the above is "usually," since not all types display the unimodal distribution described, even when the attributes chosen are explicitly stylistic and decorative.  Types suitable for frequency seriation were a subset of stylistic variation, comprising those which displayed spatial and temporal contiguity, a long enough duration that the types overlapped in their representation among sites and assemblages, and those whose distribution through time displayed the characteristic unimodal form which allowed the analyst to arrange them by eye.  The process of constructing and testing such types became known, after Krieger [-@Krieger1944], as applying the "test of historical significance."  

## Unimodality and Cultural Transmission Processes

In most cases (such as the above quote from Phillips, Ford, and Griffin), the popularity principle is simply assumed to hold in culture-historical applications.  It is clear that culture historians assumed that what generates heritable continuity, and thus allows the tracing of chronological relations, is cultural transmission.  As Lyman [-@Lyman2008] documents in careful detail, early 20th century anthropology and archaeology understood and discussed a variety of transmission processes informally, as generating the patterns they studied, even if they used different terms and did not form quantitative models for it.  Rouse [-@Rouse1939], for example, explicitly discussed the diffusion of cultural traits, in terms that we now recognize as a spatiotemporal model of transmission.  Kroeber, the father of frequency seriation, clearly understood the connection between his previous work and trait diffusion [@kroeber1937diffusion].  There are many more examples [@Lyman2008].

It was not until archaeologists began working with stochastic models of cultural transmission, however, that we could easily visualize the sheer variety of patterns that cultural transmission processes can, and do, generate.  Archaeologists had long had quantitative models of diffusion [e.g., @ammerman1971measuring], but Dunnell's [-@Dunnell1978] exposition of style as neutral variation led to adoption of stochastic models of drift from population genetics as the main tool for exploring cultural transmission dynamics.  Many previous models of diffusion tended to be deterministic, especially those stemming from the interdisciplinary literature on the diffusion of innovations [e.g., @Rogers2003].   Neiman [-@Neiman1995] simulated drift in cultural variants as an unbiased transmission process, as shown in Figure \ref{img:neiman-fig2}.  Immediately apparent is the fact that some variants do display unimodal patterns, but most variants are multimodal or display violations of unimodality at small scales even if the macroscopic shape seems to conform to the popularity principle.  

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Neiman's simulation of drift in cultural variant frequencies under unbiased cultural transmission (reproduction of Figure 2a from Neiman 1995.)}
\label{img:neiman-fig2}
\end{figure}

The lesson of Figure \ref{img:neiman-fig2} is that there is nothing necessary about unimodality given cultural transmission, but that it can occur.  But culture historical types used in seriation were __constructed__ to yield unimodal distributions, and a key element in such construction is ensuring that types are composed of multiple dimensions of variation which co-occur on artifacts identified to that type.  We can imagine selecting the traits shown in Figure \ref{img:neiman-fig2} and intersecting combinations of them to form multidimensional classes.  In doing so, it is likely that unique combinations of those variants would not recur and might show unimodal distributions more often.  It is also likely that time averaging (ubiquitous in the archaeological record) will smooth out some of the minor variation in variant frequencies, as will the vagaries of sampling archaeological deposits.  

Taken together, these factors seem to explain why the intuitive construction of historical types, from the continuous flow of the products of cultural transmission processes, worked to produce chronology through application of the common-sense popularity principle, and why not all artifact classes constructed from otherwise "stylistic" dimensions of variation, are suitable for frequency seriation using unimodality as the ordering criterion.

## Continuity:  An Alternative to Unimodality

There are several reasons why we should explore alternatives to unimodality as an ordering algorithm for frequency seriation.  First, from a performance perspective, searching for unimodal orders is computationally expensive, even for relatively small data sets [@Madsen2014].  Even with the iterative, agglomerative method that we introduced recently [@lipomadsendunnell2015], the computation time can diverge for data sets as small as 30.  This is a large number of assemblages by most archaeological standards, but with good techniques and ordering principles seriation may scale to much larger problems, and even be applicable to the flood of data seen in modern day life.  

Second, and more importantly from a theoretical perspective, it is important to be able to trace heritable continuity even if does not display a particular type of temporal frequency distribution.  Using traditional type construction methods and the test of historical significance, culture historians were able to find __enough__ conforming types and classes to construct regional chronologies.  But there is a strong relationship between the number of classes in a seriation, and our ability to map differences across space and time.  The use of seriation as a method for tracing evolutionary relationships is a more demanding task than establishing rough chronology in a region.  Thus, it is worth searching for additional ordering principles that may be useful for seriating more classes of cultural variants.  

A theoretically sound ordering principle for seriation should be derivable from characteristics of the underlying cultural transmission processes that we believe drive the spatiotemporal variation seriation measures.  Formal models of cultural transmission, such as those formulated by Boyd and Richerson, Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, and borrowed from population genetics [@Boyd1985; @Cavalli-Sforza1981;@Neiman1995] are stochastic autoregressive processes, in the sense that the probability distribution of outcomes at a given time are dependent upon the outcomes from the immediate past.  Mathematically, we usually formulate cultural transmission models as Markov processes, usually of first order (i.e., without dependencies on states previous to the immediate past state).  Such models are certainly capable of making large changes in state over short time intervals, but large jumps are rare compared to small changes in state, especially in large populations.This is the reason why we (and culture historians) often have an expectation that cultural transmission has a "gradual" character to it.   

The probabilistic gradualism of change over small time periods in our cultural transmission processes suggests a "continuity" principle, strongly related to notions of continuous functions in mathematics:  samples which originate close together in time, space, or both will be close in type frequency and the presence/absence of types, especially compared to samples which are further apart.   This continuity principle immediately leads to considering ordering algorithms based upon minimizing a suitable distance metric, with assemblages represented by points in a multidimensional space of type frequencies or counts.  



## Statistical Seriation Methods


statistical methods from Brainerd onward have tended to be approximate orderings, and that's the problem.
